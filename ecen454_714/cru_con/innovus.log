In 14.* and later releases assign nets are handled natively in Innovus. 'set init_assign_buffer {1 -buffer }' will no longer convert assigns to buffers. 'set init_remove_assigns 1' can be used in addition to 'set init_assign_buffer {1 -buffer }' if this conversion is needed. Alternatively, 'remove_assigns' command can be used to remove assign nets in the design without adding buffers.
