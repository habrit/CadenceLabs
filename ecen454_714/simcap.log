AC Analysis `Freq': freq = (10 Hz -> 1 GHz)
*******************************************

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `Freq'.
    GminDC = 1 pS is large enough to noticeably affect the DC solution.
        dV(X1.nwire) = 7.15808 mV
        Use the `gmin_check' option to eliminate or expand this report.

DC simulation time: CPU = 2.271 ms, elapsed = 1.29008 ms.
